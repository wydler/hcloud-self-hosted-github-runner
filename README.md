A GitHub Action to automatically create Hetzner Cloud servers and register them as self-hosted GitHub Actions runners.

Launch a Hetzner Cloud Server as a self-hosted GitHub Actions Runner just before your job starts.
Execute your workflow, and then automatically terminate the server upon completion.
All within your GitHub Actions workflow.

This [GitHub Action](./action.sh) is written in Bash (Shell Script).
Everything was carefully documented and kept as simple as possible.
The aim is to enable quick and easy auditability of the code.

## Use Cases

This section highlights how using Hetzner Cloud with self-hosted runners for your GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows can lead to significant cost savings and predictable billing compared to relying solely on GitHub-managed runners.

### Cost Control and Predictability

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hetzner always round up the hourly usage of a server.
> If you create a server just for a few minutes, we will still bill you for one whole hour. ([FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/billing/faq)).

* **Potentially Lower Costs for High Usage:** For organizations with consistently high CI/CD usage, self-hosting on Hetzner Cloud can be significantly more cost-effective than paying for GitHub Actions minutes, especially for larger jobs or parallel execution.
* **No Usage Limits (Within Server Capacity):** You're not restricted by GitHub Actions usage limits (within the capacity of your Hetzner Cloud Server). This is beneficial for large builds, extensive testing, or frequent deployments.

The following table provides a comparison of pricing between GitHub-managed Actions runners and Hetzner Cloud with self-hosted runners (information provided without guarantee; prices exclude VAT):

| Runner | [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing) | [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) | Cost Saving | Cost Saving (%) |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| 2 Core (Intel)  | $0.36 USD/hr | $0.0066 USD/hr | $0.3534 USD/hr | 98.17 % |
| 4 Core (Intel)  | $0.72 USD/hr | $0.0106 USD/hr | $0.7094 USD/hr | 98.53 % |
| 8 Core (Intel)  | $1.32 USD/hr | $0.0170 USD/hr | $1.3030 USD/hr | 98.71 % |
| 16 Core (Intel) | $2.52 USD/hr | $0.0314 USD/hr | $2.4886 USD/hr | 98.75 % |
| 2 Core (Arm)    | $0.30 USD/hr | $0.0074 USD/hr | $0.2926 USD/hr | 97.53 % |
| 4 Core (Arm)    | $0.48 USD/hr | $0.0122 USD/hr | $0.4678 USD/hr | 97.46 % |
| 8 Core (Arm)    | $0.84 USD/hr | $0.0226 USD/hr | $0.8174 USD/hr | 97.31 % |
| 16 Core (Arm)   | $1.56 USD/hr | $0.0443 USD/hr | $1.5157 USD/hr | 97.16 % |

GitHub prices are based on January 1, 2026.

### Customization and Control

* **Custom Hardware and Software:** You have complete control over the hardware (CPU, RAM, storage) and software environment of your runners. This allows you to:
    * Instead of the default Ubuntu-based GitHub Actions Runner image, use a specific Linux operating system image. This runner has been tested with Debian (`debian-12`), Ubuntu (`ubuntu-24.04`), Fedora Linux (`fedora-41`), Rocky Linux (`rocky-9`), openSUSE Leap (`opensuse-15`) and custom image (snapshot).
    * Install specific dependencies or tools that might not be available on GitHub-managed runners.
    * Optimize performance for your specific workloads.
* **ARM architecture:** If you need to build for architectures other than `x86_64` (Intel, AMD), you have full control to set up the appropriate  Arm-based `arm64` (Ampere Altra) runner environment.
* **Network Access and Security:** You have more control over network access and security. You can access private resources within your Hetzner Cloud network or other private networks via VPNs.
* **Larger Disk Space:** If your builds require a lot of disk space for dependencies, build artifacts, or large files, you can easily provision servers with larger disks (up to 960 GB) on Hetzner Cloud. GitHub-managed runners have limited disk space.

## Project Philosophy

This GitHub Action and project allows you to create **ephemeral** and **isolated** runners for each job or workflow.
The core design principle is **"New Workflow, New Server"**.

*   **Isolation & Security:** Every job or workflow runs in a pristine environment. There is no cross-contamination or security risk from sharing runner instances across different repositories or workflows.
*   **Lifecycle:** This Action manages the full lifecycle: `Create` -> `Run` -> `Delete` within a single workflow run.
*   **Cattle, not Pets:** Servers are disposable resources. Long-running, shared resources or maintaining a pool of persistent runners is outside the scope of this project.

## Usage

Prepare your workflow for Hetzner Cloud self-hosted runners:

1. **Create a fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with "Read and write" access to "Administration"
    * [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens →
Fine-grained personal access tokens
    * [More Help](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
1. **Generate an Hetzner Cloud API token** with "Read & Write" permissions in the Hetzner Cloud Console
    * [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) → Select project → Security → API Tokens
    * [More Help](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token)
1. **Add both tokens as repository secrets:**
    * GitHub → Select repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secrets
        * `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
        * `HCLOUD_TOKEN`: Your Hetzner Cloud API Token
    * [More Help](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
1. **Create or adapt your workflow** following the example below.

**List ARM Images:**

```bash
hcloud image list --architecture "arm" --output "columns=NAME,DESCRIPTION" --type "system" --sort "name"
```

**Create custom Image:**

Before you create a custom image of your Hetzner Cloud Server, [clean](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cli.html#clean) up the server by running on the server:

```bash
cloud-init clean --logs --machine-id --seed --configs all
```

Important: Do not shut down the server.

Create Image:

```bash
hcloud server create-image --type "snapshot" --description "github-runner-image" "[SERVER-ID]"
```

Tip: Create custom images with HashiCorp [Packer](https://github.com/hetznercloud/packer-plugin-hcloud).

**List custom Images:**

```bash
hcloud image list --output "columns=ID,DESCRIPTION,ARCHITECTURE,DISK_SIZE" --type "snapshot" --sort "name"
```

### Network

**List Networks:**

```bash
hcloud network list --output "columns=ID,NAME,IP_RANGE,SERVERS"
```

**List Primary IPs:**

```bash
hcloud primary-ip list --output "columns=ID,TYPE,NAME,IP,ASSIGNEE"
```

### SSH

**List SSH Keys:**

```bash
hcloud ssh-key list --output "columns=ID,NAME"
```

### Volumes

**List Volumes:**

```bash
hcloud volume list --output "columns=ID,NAME,LOCATION"
```

**Create Volume:**

To create a 10GB volume named `volume-test` in the Nuremberg DC Park 1 (`nbg1`) location, use the following command:

```bash
hcloud volume create --name "volume-test" --size "10" --format "ext4" --location "nbg1"
```

## Security

> We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories.
> This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.

For security considerations, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).
